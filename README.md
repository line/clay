# Clay

Clay is an Android library project that provides image trimming. Fully written in Kotlin, Clay is originally a UI component of [LINE Creators Studio](https://creator.line.me/en/studio/), a LINE app for creating LINE stickers. You can use Clay with any Android application to trim the outline of an image and create your own custom shape.

* Produce a trimmed image
* Zoom in/out an image
* Undo previous trimming actions

## How to build

Use Gradle to build the library. Download it from [JCenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter) and add configurations in the build.gradle file as follows.

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}

dependencies {
  compile 'com.linecorp:clayview:0.1.0'
}
```

## Getting started

To get started with Clay, define its view in an XML layout file as follows.

```
  <com.linecorp.clay.view.ClayView
    android:id="@+id/clay"
    android:src="@drawable/test2"
    app:strokeWidth="6dp"
    app:endPointRadius="20dp"
    app:controlPointColor="@android:color/holo_red_dark"
    app:strokeColor="@color/orange_ffcc80" />
```

Then you can use ClayView as follows.

```
val clayView = findViewById(R.id.clay) as ClayView

clayView.undoSelect() // undo
clayView.getCroppedImage() // get the cropped image

```

You can find a more advanced way of using the library from the [example](https://github.com/line/clay/tree/master/app).
